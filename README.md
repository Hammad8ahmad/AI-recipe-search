
## 🍽️ AI Recipe Search https://ai-recipe-search.vercel.app/
An AI-powered recipe search application that allows users to discover delicious recipes based on their input. Built with a React frontend,Postgres db and an Express.js backend, and powered by the Edamam API for recipe data. 

## 🚀 Features
- 🌿 Recipe Search: Search for recipes using the Edamam API.
- 📄 Save & Delete Recipes: Add favorite recipes to a list and remove them as needed.
- 🔥 Responsive Design: Fully responsive layout using Tailwind CSS.
- 🔗 Real-time Deployment:
  - Backend is deployed on DigitalOcean using Docker.
  - Frontend is deployed on Vercel with automatic deployments from GitHub.
- 📡 API Integration: Edamam API for recipe data and PostgreSQL for storage.
## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Express.js, Node.js
- Database: PostgreSQL (Dockerized)
- Deployment: DigitalOcean (Backend), Vercel (Frontend)
- API: Edamam API (for recipes)
- Docker: Docker & Docker Compose for container orchestration
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions

## 🌿 Environment Variables
You need to set up the following environment variables for both the server and client:

### 📦 Server (server/.env)
Create a .env file in the server directory:
```bash
# Production Environment
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production

# Edamam API keys
EDAMAM_APP_ID=your_edamam_app_id
EDAMAM_APP_KEY=your_edamam_app_key

# Database configuration
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name

# Production Environment
GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
PORT=3000
NODE_ENV=production

# Edamam API keys
EDAMAM_APP_ID=your_edamam_app_id
EDAMAM_APP_KEY=your_edamam_app_key

# Database configuration
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
DB_USER=your_db_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
DB_NAME=your_db_name
```
🎨 Client (client/.env)
Create a .env file in the client directory:
```bash
# API URLs
VITE_DEV_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_PROD_URL=https://your-deployed-backend-url

# API URLs
VITE_DEV_URL=http://localhost:3000
VITE_PROD_URL=https://your-deployed-backend-url
```
- VITE_DEV_URL: Used for development to connect to the backend running locally.
- VITE_PROD_URL: Used in production to connect to the deployed backend.
⚠️ **Important**: Ensure your .env files are listed in .gitignore to prevent them from being pushed to GitHub.

## 🏃‍♂️ Running the Project
### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-recipe-search.git
cd ai-recipe-search
```
### 2️⃣ Set up Environment Variables
Create .env files for both server and client following the formats mentioned above.

### 3️⃣ Run Docker Compose (for Backend + PostgreSQL)
Ensure Docker is running, then start the services:
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
### 4️⃣ Run the Client (Frontend)
Navigate to the client folder:

```bash
cd client
```
For development (with live reload):
```bash
npm run dev
```
For production (build the client):
```bash
npm run build
```
### 5️⃣ Access the Application
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173 (default Vite port)
- Backend API: http://localhost:3000
## 🚀 Deployment
### 📡 Backend (DigitalOcean)
The backend is automatically deployed using GitHub Actions.
Workflow:
- Push changes to the master branch.
- GitHub Actions will:
    - SSH into your DigitalOcean droplet.
    - Pull the latest changes.
    - Rebuild and restart Docker containers.
- The updated backend will be live at:
```bash
https://your-digitalocean-droplet-ip:3000
```
### 🎨 Frontend (Vercel)
The client is deployed on Vercel.
Workflow:

- Push changes to the master branch.
- Vercel will automatically:
    - Pull the latest changes.
    - Build the frontend.
    - Deploy to your Vercel-provided URL:
```bash
https://your-project-name.vercel.app
```
- Make sure your client uses the correct VITE_PROD_URL for API requests.
## ✅ CI/CD Workflow
The CI/CD pipeline uses GitHub Actions:

- **Backend Deployment:**
  Triggered when you push to the master branch.Runs the deployment workflow, pulling the latest code and restarting Docker containers on DigitalOcean.
- **Frontend Deployment:**
  Handled by Vercel, automatically deploying changes from the master branch.
## 📚 API Routes
The backend exposes the following REST API endpoints:



| Method | Route  | Description                |
| :-------- | :------- | :------------------------- |
|  GET | `/api/recipes` | Get all saved recipes |
|  POST  | `/api/recipes` | Save a new recipe |
|  DELETE | `/api/recipes/:id	` | Delete a saved recipe |
| GET | `/api/search?q=food	` | Search recipes via Edamam API
